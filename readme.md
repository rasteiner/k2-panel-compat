# Compatibility fork of the Kirby 2 Panel
This fork of the Kirby 2 Panel is to provide compatibility with PHP 8.1 with minimal effort. 
Functionality is not guaranteed in any way and errors are only "silenced" when encountered. PRs are welcome.

For new projects, please use the latest version of Kirby CMS.

You can find the repository for the Kirby 2 Core folder [here](https://github.com/rasteiner/k2-kirby-compat).
